# insurance_protocol

This project implements a decentralized insurance protocol on the Solana blockchain using Anchor. It allows users to purchase insurance policies, pay premiums with tokens, stake into the insurance pool, cancel policies, and submit claims. Administrators can approve claims, withdraw premiums, and manage the protocol through governance votes.
